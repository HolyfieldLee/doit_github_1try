GitHub is one of the most essential tools in IT. 
However, it’s not always easy to learn, and beginners often find it challenging to get started. 
That’s why I want to introduce GitHub in an accessible way, using the book Do it! Git & GitHub in 5 Days, published by Easy Publishing, as a foundation. 
I hope you find a lot of value here!
